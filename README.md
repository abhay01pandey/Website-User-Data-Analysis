# Website User Data Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on website user data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about user engagement across different channels and time periods. The goal is to understand user behavior, session activity and engagement rates to provide actionable insights for website optimization.


# Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

pandas (data manipulation)

numpy (numerical operations)

matplotlib & seaborn (data visualization)


# Key Steps

## Data Cleaning-

Renamed columns for clarity

Converted date and time to proper datetime format

Converted numeric columns to proper types

Created additional features (hour of the day)

## Data Analysis-

Summarized session and user counts over time

Calculated engagement metrics per channel

Explored session and engagement trends

## Data Visualization-

Line plot of sessions and users over time

Bar plots showing total users and average engagement time by channel

Boxplots for engagement rate distribution across channels

Heatmap of traffic by hour and channel

# Insights and Findings-

Identified channels with the highest user engagement

Determined peak traffic hours for better content scheduling

Highlighted differences in engagement rates among channels


# Conclusion

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in Python-based data analysis, learned to clean and manipulate real-world datasets, created informative visualizations, and gained practical experience in generating actionable insights from website user behavior.
